   - URL: http://localhost:5173 (or check your terminal)

2. **Open the app in your browser**
   - Navigate to **Water System** from the sidebar

3. **See your data!**
   - Database tab: All your meters from Supabase

- Check if meters appear in Database tab

**Option 2: Standalone Test**
- Open `test-supabase-connection.html` in browser
- Click "Test Connection"
- See sample data

**Option 3: Browser Console**
```javascript
// Open console (F12) on your app and paste:
import('./src/lib/testSupabase.js').then(m => m.testSupabaseConnection());
```

### Expected Result

✅ **Success**: You'll see your water meters displayed with:
- Meter labels
