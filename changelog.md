## [2025-01-21] - Zone Analysis Implementation

### Added
- **Enhanced Zone Analysis Section**: Implemented comprehensive Zone Analysis functionality in the Water System Monthly Dashboard
- **4-Level Hierarchy Structure**: Added complete zone hierarchy mapping including:
  - **L1**: Main Bulk (NAMA) as the primary source
  - **L2**: Zone Bulks (Zone_01_(FM), Zone_03_(A), Zone_03_(B), Zone_05, Zone_08, Zone_VS, Zone_SC)
  - **L3**: Individual meters (Villas, Building Bulk Meters, Irrigation Tanks)
  - **L4**: Apartment/Unit level meters for buildings

- **Zone Hierarchy Visualization**: 
  - Interactive tree view showing the complete 4-level water distribution system
  - Real-time consumption data display for each zone level
  - Color-coded consumption indicators (green for normal, yellow for moderate, red for high consumption)
  - Expandable/collapsible hierarchy nodes with click-to-analyze functionality

- **Backend Integration**: 
  - Connected Zone Analysis with existing backend data using WaterMeter.list() API
  - Real-time data fetching and processing for zone consumption analysis
  - Monthly consumption tracking across all zone levels

- **Enhanced UI Components**:
  - Zone selection dropdown with all major zones
  - Monthly data filtering and analysis
  - Detailed meter tables with search and pagination
  - Interactive gauges showing zone bulk, individual consumption, and water loss
  - Building drill-down capability to view L4 apartment meters

### Technical Implementation
- **Data Structure**: Implemented zone hierarchy mapping as specified in requirements
- **Component Architecture**: Created reusable ZoneHierarchyView component
- **Performance**: Added memoization and optimized re-rendering for large datasets
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation and filtering for complex zone analysis

### Zone Coverage
The implementation covers all specified zones:
- Direct Connections (11 locations including Hotel Main Building, Al Adrak Camp, etc.)
- Zone_01_(FM) with 17 building/irrigation locations
- Zone_03_(A) with 21 villas and 10 building bulk meter units
- Zone_03_(B) with 22 villas and 11 building bulk meter units  
- Zone_05 with 33 villas
- Zone_08 with 22 villas
- Zone_VS (Village Square) with 7 commercial locations
- Zone_SC (Sales Center) with caf√© and bar

This implementation provides comprehensive zone-level analysis capabilities for the water management system, enabling detailed consumption tracking, loss analysis, and system optimization insights.
