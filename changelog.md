## [2025-01-21] - Zone Analysis Implementation

### Added
- **Enhanced Zone Analysis Section**: Implemented comprehensive Zone Analysis functionality in the Water System Monthly Dashboard
- **4-Level Hierarchy Structure**: Added complete zone hierarchy mapping including:
  - **L1**: Main Bulk (NAMA) as the primary source
  - **L2**: Zone Bulks (Zone_01_(FM), Zone_03_(A), Zone_03_(B), Zone_05, Zone_08, Zone_VS, Zone_SC)
  - **L3**: Individual meters (Villas, Building Bulk Meters, Irrigation Tanks)
  - **L4**: Apartment/Unit level meters for buildings

- **Zone Hierarchy Visualization**: 
  - Interactive tree view showing the complete 4-level water distribution system
  - Real-time consumption data display for each zone level
  - Color-coded consumption indicators (green for normal, yellow for moderate, red for high consumption)
  - Expandable/collapsible hierarchy nodes with click-to-analyze functionality

- **Backend Integration**: 
  - Connected Zone Analysis with existing backend data using WaterMeter.list() API
  - Real-time data fetching and processing for zone consumption analysis
  - Monthly consumption tracking across all zone levels

- **Enhanced UI Components**:
  - Zone selection dropdown with all major zones
  - Monthly data filtering and analysis
  - Detailed meter tables with search and pagination
  - Interactive gauges showing zone bulk, individual consumption, and water loss
  - Building drill-down capability to view L4 apartment meters

### Technical Implementation
- **Data Structure**: Implemented zone hierarchy mapping as specified in requirements
- **Component Architecture**: Created reusable ZoneHierarchyView component
- **Performance**: Added memoization and optimized re-rendering for large datasets
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation and filtering for complex zone analysis

### Zone Coverage
The implementation covers all specified zones:
- Direct Connections (11 locations including Hotel Main Building, Al Adrak Camp, etc.)
- Zone_01_(FM) with 17 building/irrigation locations
- Zone_03_(A) with 21 villas and 10 building bulk meter units
- Zone_03_(B) with 22 villas and 11 building bulk meter units  
- Zone_05 with 33 villas
- Zone_08 with 22 villas
- Zone_VS (Village Square) with 7 commercial locations
- Zone_SC (Sales Center) with cafÃ© and bar

This implementation provides comprehensive zone-level analysis capabilities for the water management system, enabling detailed consumption tracking, loss analysis, and system optimization insights.

## [2025-01-21] - Fixed KPI Card Calculations

### Fixed
- **KPI Card Calculations**: Corrected the circular gauge calculations in Zone Analysis to match exact specifications:
  - **Zone Bulk Meter Total**: Now correctly shows L2 only (was already correct)
  - **Individual Meters Sum Total**: Now shows L3 Total only (previously included L4 in some zones)
  - **Water Loss Distribution**: Now correctly calculated as L2(zone Bulk) - L3(total) (previously used L3+L4)

- **Updated Trend Chart**: Chart now properly displays L2 bulk vs L3 totals comparison
- **Consistent Calculations**: All consumption calculations across the Zone Analysis section now follow the exact specification

### Technical Details
- Modified `metrics` calculation in ZoneAnalysis.jsx to use only L3 for individual meters
- Updated `zoneTrends` calculation to exclude L4 from individual meter totals
- Updated `highestLossZone` calculation for consistent zone selection
- Updated UI descriptions to clearly state the calculation formula

## [2025-01-21] - KPI Display Improvements and Debugging

### Fixed
- **Water Loss Distribution Display**: Now shows actual calculated value instead of absolute value
- **Color Coding**: Added proper color coding for loss values (red for positive loss, green for negative loss when L3 > L2)
- **Loss Description**: Improved description to handle both positive and negative loss scenarios

### Added
- **Debug Logging**: Added console logging for Zone_01_(FM) Jan-25 data to help troubleshoot any data issues
- **Version Comment**: Added version comment to help with browser cache issues

### Technical Details
- Fixed GaugeCard display logic for Water Loss Distribution
- Added conditional color coding based on loss value (positive/negative)
- Added debug logging in metrics calculation for troubleshooting
- Improved loss description text based on calculation result
